Data wrangling/cleaning process using MS Excel:

Standardizing header names: header names standardized to no-space words that represent a bit the content.

Deleting and rearranging columns: no columns deleted as it was not clear what the nexts steps with the data should be

Working with data types: eliminating several numbers that had letters before them (AAA)

Filtering data: using filters to replace the incorrect State and Gender information

Removing duplicates: duplicates according to the id (first column) removed

Correcting typos: in the gender and state columns.

Conditional Formatting

Replacing null values: difficult to do because we do not know what columns are the main ones that will be used later on.
